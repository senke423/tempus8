# tempus8

Tempus VIII is a CLI productivity application. It focuses around measuring time spent on various activities. It is not meant to track *everything* someone does in day, rather - work, hobbies, or anything else that could be described as "productive" or "useful". Time tracking is not done within the app, it only records and processes such data. 

The purpose is to somehow quantify productivity. That's why there are so many features related to statistics, daily and weekly goals. Although *time spent doing something* is a rather simplistic and incomplete way of quantifying productivity, it is good enough, and it certainly works for me.
